# Web Data Visualization of The Corona Virus using Plotly

The following project will utilize chloropleths and geographical data to visualize the coronavirus pandemic. The visualization contains a timeline and a map of the world. As the slider on the timeline progresses, more sections of the world map will be shaded. THe shading denotes the country being infected.

The bar chart added is a visualization of how many cases a country has. It is an interactive stacked bar chart where the user can select which countries they would like to see by selecting countries in the legend.

To create this visualization, numpy, pandas, plotly, and python were used.

## Summary:

The Corona Virus has made a profound impact on the current state of the entire planet. It has shattered the norms, routines, and ways people operate to a degree that it will take a long while before we return to what is considered normal.

Here, I build a set visualizations of the corona virus. It will help the user see a timeline of the spread of the virus, affected countries, and amount of lives it has affected. Confirmed cases and deaths have been taken into account for this analysis. 

While we are living in the moment of the virus and its consequences, we only receive our data from the news outlets available to us. This visualization help aid users to see the data, without the input of news agencies, or political bias. What users will see is, the simple numbers of the severity of the pandemic.
