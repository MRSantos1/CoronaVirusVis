The following project will utilize chloropleths and geographical data to visualize the coronavirus pandemic. The visualization contains a timeline and a map of the world. As the slider on the timeline progresses, more sections of the world map will be shaded. THe shading denotes the country being infected.

The bar chart added is a visualization of how many cases a country has. It is an interactive stacked bar chart where the user can select which countries they would like to see by selecting countries in the legend.

To create this visualization, numpy, pandas, plotly, and python were used.
